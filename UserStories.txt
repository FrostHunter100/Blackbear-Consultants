My contribution of user stories:

User Story 1 
As a user (clinician), I want to have access to a visual representation of the progress of the child so that I know how the child progressed throughout the use of the application.
User Story 2
	As a user (clinician), I want to have access to what the child is struggling on in the application so that I know what to work on with the child in person.
User Story 3
	As a child using the application, I want the game to seem fun and colorful so that I keep playing to learn my shapes and colors, while not seeming overly frustrating while learning.
